      <!--paragraph about my drawing life-->
 <p>I have been drawing for a long time. I do it when I have nothing to do, or when an idea just pops into my head! I take drawing classes and I also like sculpting and things involving paper. Many of my drawings include people, birds, and some nature. Drawing can calm yourself down, and it is very fun to do.

    <!--paragraph of science-->
    <p>I am interested in science. I love conducting experiments, learning something I did not know, and discovering new things. I ask lots of questions, and I learn very quickly. That's what my friends say, at least.</p>

  <h3>Writing</h3>
    <p>I love writing and making up short stories. I like writing for fun but I don't like writing essays for school or something specific that I have to do. That's VERY boring. My favorite genres are fiction and biography, because I like reading and learning about people I didn't know before.</p>
    <h3>My favorite animals</h3>
    <p>I love animals. I used to have fish, and I wish that my family had a dog (I might even get one soon). Here are some of my favorites.</p>
    <h4>Tigers</h4>
    <p>I like tigers because I think that their stripes look very cool, and tiger cubs are very cute. Tiger moms are very protective of their babies.</p>

    <h4>Dogs</h4>
    <p>Dogs are fun to play with and they are very friendly. Unlike some other animals(*cough* cats *cough*), they will always be around for you.</p>
